Data Stewardship Wizard leaflet

## Usage

There are two SVG files with rollfold pages of the DS Wizard leaflet. It is automatically converted to PDF file for releases. So, you don't need to clone and build it on your own - just visit [releases].

Together with our [diagrams], we use No-Derivatives license to prevent misuse of our work (placing other work into it and presenting it as the Wizard) and misleading our potential users. If you have ideas for improvements or need a customization, please contact us via [issues].
